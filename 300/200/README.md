# 200 - Usage

Based on "Claude Dev: Build Web Apps Without Writing A Single Code" at https://www.zeniteq.com/blog/claude-dev-build-web-apps-without-writing-a-single-code

Once Claude Dev is set up, let’s try to create an app with it.

```
Prompt: Make a Tetris game with a life and a scoring system. Use flashy colors
```

For this task, Claude needs to create new files on your local disk. It prompts you to allow or decline the AI to make changes to your file system.

After a few seconds, Claude Dev was able to generate the files, saved them to my desktop, and the Tetris game is now ready to be played.

According to Sauod, files will be saved in the open workspace in VS Code and will default to desktop if there’s none.

> I enforce the LLM to only work within the open workspace in VSCode, or if no workspace is open it defaults to the Desktop. But you can try to override this by telling it to operate at a specific path.

Simply click on the “Run command” button to start the game.

Awesome! With a single prompt, I was able to create a fully working Tetris game.

You can make further modifications to the game. For example, I wanted to add a guide on how to play the game.

```
Prompt: Add a tutorial on the left side of the game canvas to guide the user on how to play the game.
```

Overall, this mini-game took two minutes and a quarter of a dollar to make.

- Upload Tokens: 47,57
- Download Tokens: 45,061
- API Cost: $0.2186

Quite cheap but this could easily blow up once you start building bigger projects.

Anyway, what’s great about this is that the files generated by Claude Dev are all stored in your local machine so you can manually update them whenever you want.
