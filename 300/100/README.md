Open VS Code and search for “Claude Dev” in Marketplace. Install the extension and it should be added on the left vertical tabs of the IDE.

Next, open up the Claude Dev extension and notice that it will require you to input an API key. Follow the steps below to get your API key:

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. You may need to buy some credits (although Anthropic is offering $5 free credit for new users)
3. Click ‘Get API Keys’ and create a new key for me (you can delete it any time)

Paste the API key on the Claude Dev and finally click on the “Let’s go!” button.

It’s important to know that you need to have credits on your Anthropic account. You can choose to link your credit card or claim the free $5 credits by adding your phone number.
