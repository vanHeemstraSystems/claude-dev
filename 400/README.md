# 400 - Conclusion

Claude Dev is a very promising technology. We are finally getting close to having the ability to create full-blown applications and websites using AI alone.

One major concern I have is that it uses a large number of tokens per execution, burning through tokens like a kid at an arcade. I hope that more talented developers will come up with solutions to fix the token issue, perhaps through open-source alternatives.

I encourage you to try out Claude Dev and explore its capabilities. Let me know what you think about it.
